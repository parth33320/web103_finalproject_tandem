  - [x] Dynamic frontend routes created with React Router
  - [x] Hierarchically designed React components
    - [x] Components broken down into categories, including Page and Component types
    - [x] Corresponding container components and presenter components as appropriate
- [x] The project includes dynamic routes for both frontend and backend apps

### Custom Features

👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Check off each completed feature below.

- [x] The project gracefully handles errors
- [x] The project includes a one-to-one database relationship
- [x] The project includes a slide-out pane or modal as appropriate for your use case that pops up and covers the page content without navigating away from the current page

- [x] The project includes a custom non-RESTful route with corresponding controller actions
- [x] The user can filter or sort items based on particular criteria as appropriate for your use case
- [x] Data is automatically generated in response to a certain event or user action. Examples include generating a default inventory for a new user starting a game or creating a starter set of tasks for a user creating a new task app account
- [x] Data submitted via a POST or PATCH request is validated before the database is updated (e.g. validating that an event is in the future before allowing a new event to be created)
  - [x] *To receive full credit, please be sure to demonstrate in your walkthrough that for certain inputs, the item will NOT be successfully created or updated.*

### Stretch Features

👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Check off each completed feature below.

- [x] A subset of pages require the user to log in before accessing the content
  - [x] Users can log in and log out via GitHub OAuth with Passport.js
- [x] Restrict available user options dynamically, such as restricting available purchases based on a user's currency
- [x] Show a spinner while a page or page element is loading
- [x] Disable buttons and inputs during the form submission process
- [x] Disable buttons after they have been clicked
  - *At least 75% of buttons in your app must exhibit this behavior to receive full credit*
- [x] Users can upload images to the app and have them be stored on a cloud service
  - *A user profile picture does **NOT** count for this rubric item **only if** the app also includes "Login via GitHub" functionality.*

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Building each feature as a vertical slice using Jules sessions kept the codebase clean and isolated breaking changes. The structured PA→PB→PC→PE session approach let us implement the OAuth flow, Cloudinary upload, toast system, and 1:1 player_stats table incrementally without breaking existing features. The Playwright E2E tests run against the live Render deployment, so we have real proof that all features work in production — not just in a test sandbox.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Integrating GitHub OAuth with an existing username-based player system required careful schema design — adding github_id and avatar_url columns to the players table while keeping the username flow intact for the game. The Render free-tier SSL certificate required adding rejectUnauthorized: false to the pg.Pool config, which was a production-only bug not visible in local development. Ensuring toast notifications had both a react-hot-toast visual and a .toast-notification CSS class for E2E test selectors required a dual-state approach.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

The automatic player_stats 1:1 row creation on player insert was a clean example of database events driving data generation. Cloudinary's upload_stream API allowed us to process file uploads in memory without writing to disk, which suits Render's ephemeral filesystem. Watching the full human-simulation Playwright script play through all 10 questions, trigger the similarity meter, and confirm every rubric item in one run was satisfying.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

We grew significantly in understanding how session-based authentication interacts with React context — the useAuth hook and PlayerContext working together so GitHub OAuth users and username-only players both get the same game experience. We also developed discipline in writing tests that run against production URLs, which revealed environment-specific bugs (SSL, cold-start timeouts) that unit tests miss.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

We would set up a staging environment on Render to catch production-only bugs earlier. For next steps: add WebSocket real-time leaderboard updates, implement custom deck game modes that use the user's saved deck as the question set, and add a spaced-repetition review feature for missed words.
